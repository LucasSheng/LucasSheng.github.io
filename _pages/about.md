I am a Professor at the [School of Software, Beihang University (BUAA)](http://soft.buaa.edu.cn/), China.

Before I joined BUAA in 2019, I was a postdoctoral researcher (2017-2019) in [MMLab@CUHK](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). I received my Ph.D. from [Department of Electronic Engineering](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/en-gb/) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), advised by [Prof. King Ngi Ngan](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~knngan/) (IEEE Life Fellow).

My research interests include 3D computer vision and embodied AI. **My current research lies in developing generalizable models for understanding, interacting with and synthesizing 3D visual world.**

<!-- - **Perception**: How to robustly perceive semantics and geometries in the wild?
- **Reasoning**: How to perform transparent and trustworthy reasoning for language-grounded tasks?
- **Synthesis**: How to synthesize high-fidelity 2D/3D contents controlled by cross-modal guidance? -->
